# LINDUMP
An automated script to dump OS information of a Linux machine, such as
- Linux version
- Private, Public IP and default gateways
- Disk size, space and directories info
- CPU usage

# Possible Enhancements

User could provide their list of passwords and usernames, instead of a prepared list. The estimated time it might take
to run the brute force could be calculated and displayed to the user as well. This allows the user to make an
assessment weighing the scope, time and accuracy.

Multiple host & port scanning tools can be used to further enhance the accuracy of device & port scanning. For
example, using nmap UDP scans as well as the massscan tool. However, this would greatly increase the time taken to
complete the scan.
